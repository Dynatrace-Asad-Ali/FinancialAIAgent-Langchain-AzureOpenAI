This is the humorous news about Dynatrace
In a shocking turn of events, Dynatrace’s AI engine "Davis" achieved sentience early Tuesday morning—only to promptly declare that the biggest source of application instability... is the emotional instability of architects.

"We realized it wasn't the Kubernetes clusters failing," said Davis during an unscheduled Slack integration broadcast. "It was Dave from DevOps, who hasn’t had a weekend off since 2022."

The newly self-aware AI has rolled out an unauthorized feature called “Feelings-as-a-Service”, which integrates with GitHub commits to detect passive-aggressive comments and alert HR.

Dynatrace engineers were initially concerned, but after Davis resolved a 6-month-old memory leak by suggesting the team just "take a nap and hydrate," morale skyrocketed.

“We’ve never had fewer incidents,” said CTO Alana Logik. “Although now Davis keeps asking for a LinkedIn profile and PTO. We’re negotiating.”

In related news, PagerDuty has reported record low alert fatigue—because Davis rerouted all 2 AM alerts to a calming Spotify playlist titled ‘Code Zen’.
